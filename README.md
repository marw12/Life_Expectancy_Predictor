# Life Expectancy Predictor

There have been many studies undertaken in the past which detail factors that affect life expectancy using demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates; it was found that what was lacking is the effect of immunization and HDI, these aspects were not taken into account. Past research conducted on multiple linear regression was based on a dataset of only one year for all countries. This was not as conclusive or intricate as this analysis calls for, instead, I formulated a multiple linear regression model to encompass all components, including immunization, mortality, economic, social and other health related factors, from a period of 2000-2015, in all countries. This will help countries predict areas of improvement to ameliorate the life expectancy of its population.

The dataset was obtained from kaggle.com, found on the World Health Organisationâ€™s (WHO) repository website, its corresponding economic data was collected from the United Nations website. After considering all factors in the dataset, the following multiple linear regression equation was produced:

Life_Expectancy = -1.6*status + -0.02*adult_mortality + 0.16*infant_deaths + 0.085*alcohol + 0.00057*%_expenditure + -0.017*hepatitis_B + -0.000023*measles + 0.044*BMI + -0.13*under_five_deaths + 0.029*polio + -0.0026*total_expenditure + 0.048*diphtheria + -0.72*HIV + -0.000033*GDP + 0.000000014*population + -0.026*thinness_1-19 + -0.072*thinness_5-9 + 4.6*income_composition + 0.52*Schooling + 59.20

We can observe from the value of the coefficients that the HDI in terms of income composition of resources has the most significant impact on the life expectancy, followed by whether a country is developed/developing and HIV/AIDS deaths per 1000 live births. I disregarded population, GDP, measles and Expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP per capita, their impact was insignificant compared to the other factors.

In-terms of accuracy I was able to achieve a very reliable Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) value of : 4.04
